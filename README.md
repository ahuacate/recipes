## 1.00 Cinnabon Hacks
This recipe is a hash of many sources and works for us.

Prerequisites are:
- [x] Use Panasonic bread mixer which has a dough only function and a yeast dispenser
- [x] Oven of course
- [x] A partner who doesnt get fat eating the whole batch of Cinnabons in one day


| Half Batch | Full Batch | Ingredient | Notes
| :---:  | :---: | :--- | :---
| **For the Dough**
| 0,5 | 1 | Cup warm milk | *About 45deg C*
| 1,25 tps | 2,5 tps | Instant dry yeast
| 1 | 2 | Large eggs at room temperature
| 38g | 76g | Unsalted Vutter | *Room temperature cut into small cubes*
| 315g | 630g| All-purpose flour (divided) | *These are our sweet spot weights for flour. Most recipes start with 288/576g respectively*
| 0,5 tps | 1,0 tps | Salt 
| 32g | 64g | White Sugar
| **For the Filling**
| 57g | 114g | Butter | *Room temp, soft.*
| 100g | 200g | Brown Sugar
| 1 tsp | 2 tsp | Maple Syrup or Golden Syrup | *Golden syrup is best in our opinion*
| 1 tbs | 2 tbs | Cinnamon
| 0,5 tsp | 1 | Vanilla Essense
| **Prebake Topping**
| 57g | 114g | Heavy Cream
| **For the Frosting**
| 85g | 170g | Softened Cream Cheese
| 38g | 76g | Unsalted Butter
| 125g | 250g | Powdered Sugar (aka icing sugar)
| 0,25 tbs | 0,5 tbs | Maple extract or vanilla essence

### 1.01 Step 1 
Pour the warm milk into your bread machine. Add the eggs, butter, salt and sugar. Add the yeast into the dispenser. Start the machine on the dough function. 

Its Menu 9 on my Panasonic Breadmaker. The whole process takes one hour and includes a warm dough rising.

### 1.02 Step 2
While the dough is rising, prepare the cinnamon filling.

In a medium bowl, combine the soft butter, brown sugar, maple syrup or golden syrup, vanilla essense and cinnamon, mixing until well combined. Set aside.

### 1.03 Step 3
Traditionalists, sprinkle a pastry mat generously with flour. Lazy efficient amateurs, spray your silicon rolling mat or surface with spray oil.

Turn out the dough onto the pastry mat. Using your fingers gently form the dough into a rectange 35-40cm x 30cm (based on half batch measurements). Use a rolling pin if you like. I simply jab the dough with my finger tips as if I am making Focaccia.

### 1.04 Step 4
Now spread all the filling mixure across the rolled dough leaving edge closest to you clean (about 20mm, to help with sealing the finished roll).

### 1.05 Step 5 
Starting on the far edge, roll the dough up tightly jelly roll style. Cut into 6 slices (based on half batch) using the string method and place in two greased 8½ x 4½ x 2½ inch Loaf Pans. So you have 3x rolls per pan.

### 1.05 Step 6
Cover the pans and allow the rolls to rise for 60 minutes or until nearly double. Its 60min in my oven set on ferment 40C.

### 1.06 Step 7
Preheat the oven to 190C (180C if fan forced). Warm the heavy cream until the chill is off. Don’t make it hot, you just don’t want it cold. It should be warm to the touch.

Once the rolls have risen, pour the heavy cream over the top of the rolls, allowing it to soak down in and around the rolls.

Bake at 180C (fan forced) for 16 minutes, until the rolls are lightly golden brown and the center rolls are cooked through.

The time will vary based on how big the rolls are, what type of pan, how close the rolls are packed, etc. They could take up to 25 minutes. For me 16 minutes @ 180C fan forced was perfect.

### 1.07 Step 8
Never done this step as the stranger half doesnt like cheese frosting. 

While the rolls are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting.

In a large bowl, combine the softened cream cheese and butter using a hand mixer. Blend well. Add in your favorite extract and the powdered sugar. Beat until combined.

Spread the frosting over the cooled rolls. Store in an airtight container.

### 1.08 Step 9
Eat the little fluffy bastards.
