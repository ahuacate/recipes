## 1.00 Cinnabon Buns
This recipe works for us.

Prerequisites are:
- [x] A Panasonic bread maker (or any brand) which has a dough only function and a yeast dispenser. Life saver.
- [x] A oven.
- [x] A partner who doesn't get fat eating all six Cinnabons in one day!


| Half Batch | Full Batch | Ingredient | Notes
| :---:  | :---: | :--- | :---
| 6 rolls | 12 rolls
| **For the Dough**
| 0,5 | 1 | Cup warm milk | *About 45deg C*
| 1,25 tps | 2,5 tps | Instant dry yeast
| 1 | 2 | Large eggs at room temperature
| 38g | 76g | Unsalted Butter | *Room temperature cut into small cubes*
| 315g | 630g| All-purpose flour (sifted) | *These are our sweet spot weights for flour. Most recipes start with 288/576g respectively*
| 0,5 tps | 1,0 tps | Salt 
| 32g | 64g | White Sugar
| **For the Filling**
| 57g | 114g | Butter | *Room temp, soft.*
| 100g | 200g | Brown Sugar
| 1 tsp | 2 tsp | Maple Syrup or Golden Syrup | *Golden syrup is best in our opinion*
| 1 tbs | 2 tbs | Cinnamon Powder
| 0,5 tsp | 1 | Vanilla Essense
| n/a | n/a | *Add some soft dried raisons*
| **Prebake Topping**
| 57g | 114g | Heavy Cream
| **For the Frosting**
| 85g | 170g | Softened Cream Cheese
| 38g | 76g | Unsalted Butter
| 125g | 250g | Powdered Sugar (aka icing sugar)
| 0,25 tbs | 0,5 tbs | Maple extract or vanilla essence

### 1.01 Step 1 
Pour the warm milk into your bread machine. Add the flour, eggs, butter, salt and sugar. Add the yeast into the dispenser. Start the machine on the dough function. 

FYI the dough function is `Menu 9` on my Panasonic Breadmaker. The whole process takes about one hour and includes a warm dough rising. Its completely painless.

### 1.02 Step 2
While the dough is rising, prepare your cinnamon filling.

In a medium bowl, combine the soft butter, brown sugar, maple syrup or golden syrup, vanilla essense and cinnamon, mixing until well combined. Set aside.

### 1.03 Step 3
Traditionalists, sprinkle a pastry mat generously with flour. Lazy efficient amateurs, spray your silicon rolling mat or surface with spray oil.

Turn out the dough onto the pastry mat. Using your fingers gently form the dough into a rectange 35-40cm x 30cm (based on half batch measurements).Give it time to relax bewteen stretching.  Or use a rolling pin (I don't). I simply jab the dough with my finger tips as if I am making Focaccia and ply the dough into a rectangle.

### 1.04 Step 4
Now spread the filling mixure across the rolled dough leaving the edge closest to you clean (about 20mm, to help with sealing the finished roll).

### 1.05 Step 5 
Starting on the far edge, roll the dough up tightly jelly roll style. Cut into 6 slices (based on half batch) using the string method and place in two greased 8½ x 4½ x 2½ inch Loaf Pans. So you have 3x rolls per pan.

### 1.05 Step 6
Cover the pans and allow the rolls to rise for 60 minutes or until nearly double. Its 60min in my oven set on 40C ferment cycle.

### 1.06 Step 7
Preheat the oven to 190C (180C if fan forced). Warm the heavy cream until the chill is off. Don’t make it hot, you just don’t want it cold. It should be warm to the touch.

Once the rolls have risen, drizzle the heavy cream over the top of the rolls, allowing it to soak down in and around the rolls.

Bake at 180C (fan forced) for 16 minutes, or until the rolls are lightly golden brown and the center rolls are cooked through.

The time will vary based on how big your rolls are, what type of pan, how close the rolls are packed, etc. They could take up to 20 minutes or more. For me 16 minutes @ 180C fan forced was perfect.

### 1.07 Step 8
Never done this step as the strange better half of me doesn't like cheese frosting. But why not finish these beauties off.

While the rolls are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting.

In a large bowl, combine the softened cream cheese and butter using a hand mixer. Blend well. Add in your favorite extract and the powdered sugar. Beat until combined.

Spread the frosting over the cooled rolls. Store in an airtight container.

### 1.08 Step 9
Eat the little fluffy bastards.

### 1.09 Step 10
If you don't have a bread maker then buy one. Its one of those kitchen machines you buy but rarely use. But for making dough (forget baking bread in them) is a life saver.
